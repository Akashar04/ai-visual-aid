# Ai-Visual-Aid
# 🎯 AI-Based Real-Time Object Identifier & Reader for Visually Impaired

This project is a web application designed to help **visually impaired individuals** identify objects, read printed text, and understand their location — all through **voice feedback**.

---

## 🧠 What it Does

- ✅ **Detects objects in front of the camera** using AI.
- ✅ **Reads out any text it sees** (like signs or books).
- ✅ **Tells the user their current location**.
- ✅ **Speaks everything aloud**, so the user doesn't need to look at the screen.
- ✅ **Explains objects** in simple language using Groq AI.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user opens the website and allows camera access.
2. Click on:
   - 🔹 `Detect Objects` — to find and announce visible objects.
   - 🔹 `Recognize Text` — to read text from images or signs.
   - 🔹 `Where Am I?` — to get the current location.
3. All outputs are spoken using voice feedback.
4. The tool also gives a **short explanation** about detected objects using the Groq AI API.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **React.js** (Frontend)
- **TensorFlow.js** + `@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd` (Object detection)
- **Tesseract.js** (Text recognition)
- **Web Speech API** (Voice output)
- **Groq API** (AI-based object explanation)
- **Google Maps API** (Location info)

💡 Why this Project?

Many visually impaired people rely on others for help with reading or identifying things around them.
This project gives them a small level of independence using AI + voice.
